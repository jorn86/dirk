## Dirk Dependency Injection
A fully compile time generated DI framework, inspired by Google's Dagger but much simpler.

### Done
* Basic injection
* Factory / provider injection
* Singletons
* Thread local scope
* Custom scope (You could use this to build e.g. Request scope)
* Provider functions
* Assisted injection
* Lifecycle handling (Post construct & Pre destroy)
* Method injection (for those cases where a framework controls instance creation)

### To do
* Ignore annotation
* Multi-project support
* Set & list bindings
* Optional injection
